      <p>My name is Ethan Krieg and I am a former Technical Recruiter from St. Louis, Missouri. My main hobbies include exercise, cooking, videogames, and traveling. I discovered my interest in software development during my time as a Technical Recruiter. I frequently spoke with Engineers of all disciplines and found myself enamored by their experiences. I view full stack development as an in-demand skillset that can provide interesting and rewarding challenges.</p>
